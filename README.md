# odin-recipes

This is a project to set up a basic HTML page before the use of CSS and JS can be added.

This should cover:
- Boilerplate HTML
- Headings and Paragraph tags
- Anchor tags that href to other locations
- img tags to include images on the page
- Lists to show ordered steps for each recipe
